#### Conditional Replenishment of JPEG2000 tiles with Motion Compensation

**Notes** 
* Reduces the inter-frame redundancy present in common JPEG2000 sequences (MJP2 sequences).
* Applies a real-time motion compensation technique to the MJP2 sequences before transmission.
* They propose transmitting only the tiles that change in each JPEG2000 frame.
* *Review*: the method proposed for real-time tile change detection.

#### Conditional Replenishment of JPEG2000 code-blocks with Motion Compensation

**Notes** 
* Too complex to be applied in real-time environments.
* Clients and servers have to be purposely designed for use with these techniques.

**Notes**
* They propose a rate-distortion optimal strategy to select the most profitable packets to transmit. 
* They provide the client with two references, the previous reconstructed frame and an estimation of the current scene background, which improves the transmission system performances.
