## Daala
* [Daala](https://xiph.org/daala/) is the code-name for a new video compression technology. The effort is a collaboration between Mozilla Foundation, Xiph.Org Foundation and other contributors.  
The goal of the project is to provide a free to implement, use and distribute digital media format and reference implementation with technical performance superior to h.265.

This talk will cover our success with Opus and our plans for Daala and how we will create codec infrastructure which is convincingly royalty free, has state-of-the-art performance, and can be easily deployed and integrated, with the hope that someday everyone can stop worrying about codecs and go on to build fantastic things without having to compromise on performance or navigating licensing.
