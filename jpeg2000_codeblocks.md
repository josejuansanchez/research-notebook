### JPEG2000 codeblocks
* [Implication of variable code block size in JPEG 2000 and its VLSI implementation](file:///home/josejuan/Downloads/9c960516d07ce29dc2.pdf). 

In JPEG 2000 standard, all the code blocks within the same tile of a component need to have the same width and height 
according to the JPEG 2000 standard. The width and height information of a code block are specified in either the 
coding style default (COD) and/or coding style component (COC) marker segments. However, the constraint of fixed 
code block size is due to the fact that COD and/or COC marker segments in a JPEG 2000 compressed file only can carry 
one set of code block width and height information for an image or a tile or a component. We have studied the 
implication of using variable code block sizes at different DWT resolution levels instead of the fixed size code blocks 
prescribed by JPEG 2000 standard. The simulation results show that there is no significant impact on compression 
efficiency if one uses different code block sizes at different DWT levels compared to the fixed size code block size.
