### Tools
* [DSSIM C implementation](https://github.com/pornel/dssim).
  This tool computes (**dis**)similarity between two **PNG** images using algorithms approximating human vision. [More info]( http://pornel.net/dssim).

* [PYSSIM Python implementation](https://github.com/jterrace/pyssim). A Python module for computing the Structural Similarity Image Metric (SSIM). Original code written by Antoine Vacavant from http://isit.u-clermont1.fr/~anvacava/code.html, with modifications by Christopher Godfrey and Jeff Terrace.
