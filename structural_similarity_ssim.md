  Note: "SSIM is widely used method for measurement of image quality. It works accurately can measure better across distortion types as compared to MSE and PSNR, but **fails in case of highly blurred image**."


## Tools

### SSIM (Structural Similarity)

* [Matlab/Octave implementation](https://github.com/josejuansanchez/ssim).

* [PYSSIM Python implementation](https://github.com/jterrace/pyssim). A Python module for computing the Structural Similarity Image Metric (SSIM). Original code written by Antoine Vacavant from http://isit.u-clermont1.fr/~anvacava/code.html, with modifications by Christopher Godfrey and Jeff Terrace.

* [SSIM implementation for OpenCV2.x (c++)](http://nma.web.nitech.ac.jp/fukushima/opencv/ssim/ssim-e.html).


### DSSIM (Structural Dissimilarity)

* [DSSIM C implementation](https://github.com/pornel/dssim).
  This tool computes (**dis**)similarity between two **PNG** images using algorithms approximating human vision. [More info]( http://pornel.net/dssim).

* [DSSIM C++ implementation](http://pholia.tdi.informatik.uni-frankfurt.de/~philipp/software/dssim.shtml).
