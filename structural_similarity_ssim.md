  Note: "SSIM is widely used method for measurement of image quality. It works accurately can measure better across distortion types as compared to MSE and PSNR, but **fails in case of highly blurred image**."

## Tools

### SSIM (Structural Similarity)

* [SSIM Matlab/Octave implementation](https://github.com/josejuansanchez/ssim).


### DSSIM (Structural Dissimilarity)

* [DSSIM C implementation](https://github.com/pornel/dssim).
  This tool computes (**dis**)similarity between two **PNG** images using algorithms approximating human vision. [More info]( http://pornel.net/dssim).
